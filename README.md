# Python-projects
This repo lists all the mini Python projects I compiled focusing on automation and web development

Priject Price Tracker:
This python script is build to track prices of a product on an E-commerce site and send a customized mail notification on price rise/drop. 
Steps to run it:
1. Create a config.py python file in your directory and store your mail and password for better security. This script will not work without a config file.
2. Python files are to be manually called but if you want to schedule run use cron(google it) to schedule it and track the price or availability. 
3. Contributions are welcome to integrate the script into an app or web app.
